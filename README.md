# Geo-Resistivity-meter
Hardware and software repository for a geophysical instrument

Here will be stored all files and data required to build a soil resistivity meter for geophysical survey applications. This is a scientific instrument under development at the Laboratory for the Development of Magnetic Sensors (LDSM) of the National Observatory, based in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil (https://www.gov.br/observatorio/pt-br).
