# Geo-Resistivity-meter
Hardware and software repository for a geophysical instrument

Here will be stored all files and data needed to build a soil resistivity meter for geophysical survey applications. This is a scientific instrument under development at the sensor laboratory (LDSM) of the National Observatory, based in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil (https://www.gov.br/observatorio/pt-br)
